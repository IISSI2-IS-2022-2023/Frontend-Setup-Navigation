# 1. First React Native project

## Steps:
1. Once you accepted this assignment, clone your repository to your local environment.
2. Open VS Code, open a new terminal.
3. Create a new empty react-native project by running:
`expo init IISSI2-IS-Frontend-Owner`
   * Choose template: `blank`
4. In order to launch the project as a web application project, navigate to the created folder:
`cd IISSI2-IS-Frontend-Owner`
5. And run the following command:
`npx expo install react-native-web@~0.18.10 react-dom@18.2.0 @expo/webpack-config@^18.0.1`
6. Finally, run `npm start` and press `w` (Run in web browser) once terminal ask you about deployment options
   * A new tab/window on your browser should open http://localhost:19006/ showing the demo projects. If not automatically opened, run your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:19006
   * (On windows) set allow on Firewall/Windows defender if asked
   * It should open the basic empty project in a new tab. It should look like this:
https://snack.expo.dev/@afdez/lab4-1-blankproject
7. Configure eslint by installing and initialize it for your project by running `npm install eslint --save-dev`and `npx eslint --init`. We recommend the following answers: To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style, JavaScript modules (import/export), React, Does your project use TypeScript? â€º No, Where does your code run? Browser, Use a popular style guide, Standard: https://github.com/standard/standard, Format-> Javascript. Finally select yes to install all dependencies and when asked about package manager do you want to use, select npm. If you are asked to do some downgrade, answer yes. See https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started for more details.
8. Modify eslint file in order to add the last rule.
```Javascript
module.exports = {
  env: {
    browser: true,
    es2021: true
  },
  extends: [
    'plugin:react/recommended',
    'standard'
  ],
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaFeatures: {
      jsx: true
    },
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module'
  },
  plugins: [
    'react'
  ],
  rules: {
    'react/prop-types': 'off'
  }
}

````

   * After that it is recommended to include a settings file by running `mkdir .vscode` and  `touch .vscode/settings.json`. Add the following contents at `.vscode/settings.json`:
```Javascript
{
    "eslint.lintTask.enable": true,
    "eslint.alwaysShowStatus": true,
    "eslint.format.enable": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.eslint": true
    },
    "eslint.validate": [
        "javascript"
    ]
}
````

Remember that, for a better experience, use the VSCode Extension for eslint: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint

9. Sync and push your changes to your repository.

# 2. Tab navigation
According to the requirements, we can classify owners functionalities in the following categories:
* Profile (login, logout and edit his profile)
* Restaurants (listing owned restaurants, create and edit them), navigate to its orders as well.
* Control panel showing business stats

We propose to create a Tab navigation using Reactnavigation tools, and following these steps (detailed documentation can be found at: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation)

## Steps:
0. Install react navigation dependencies by running `expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context` and `npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs`. We will also install stack navigator and other dependencies for the future by running `npm install @react-navigation/native-stack` and `npm install @react-navigation/native`

1. Create folders and files:
   * Create a new folder `src/screens`
   * Create a folder for each tab `src/screens/profile`, `src/screens/restaurants`, `src/screens/controlPanel`
   * For each folder we will create a simple screen, `ProfileScreen.js`, `RestaurantsScreen.js`and `ControlPanelScreen.js`
    > you can create these folders and files using the terminal by running:

    ```Powershell
    mkdir src && mkdir src/screens && mkdir src/screens/profile && mkdir src/screens/restaurants && mkdir src/screens/controlPanel && touch src/screens/profile/ProfileScreen.js && touch src/screens/restaurants/RestaurantsScreen.js && touch src/screens/controlPanel/ControlPanelScreen.js
    ```

    Depending on your terminal/shell, you could need to change `&&` to `;`
2. Include a minimal screen for each screen file created. E.g. RestaurantsScreen.js

```Javascript
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

export default function RestaurantsScreen () {
  return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
            <Text>Restaurants</Text>
        </View>
  )
}
```

3. Overwrite the contents of `App.js` the logic to create a tab navigator
```Javascript
import { createBottomTabNavigator } from '@react-navigation/bottom-tabs'
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native'
import * as React from 'react'
import ControlPanelScreen from './src/screens/controlPanel/ControlPanelScreen'
import ProfileScreen from './src/screens/profile/ProfileScreen'
import RestaurantsScreen from './src/screens/restaurants/RestaurantsScreen'

const Tab = createBottomTabNavigator()

export default function App () {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Tab.Navigator>
        <Tab.Screen
          name="Restaurants"
          component={RestaurantsScreen} />
        <Tab.Screen
          name="Control Panel"
          component={ControlPanelScreen} />
        <Tab.Screen
          name="Profile"
          component={ProfileScreen} />
      </Tab.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  )
}
```
4. Check the new version of the project, it should works like this:
https://snack.expo.dev/@afdez/lab4-2-basicnavigation
5. Commit and push your changes to your repository. Open Source control tab in VSCode to commit and push your project.
   * Additionally you can create a tag `Git: Create tag`, name it (e.g. `lab4-2-basicNavigation`), and finally `Git: Push tags`

# 3. Stack navigation nested in the tab navigator

Some screens should present a stack-type navigation. We are going to follow the steps below to include a stack navigator within the Restaurants tab, we will have a listing of all restaurants, and if you click on one, it will navigate to show the detail of that restaurant. The following video shows a stack navigator:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19324988/155882422-5974b582-4a6e-4ad0-8df6-31b504b791e5.mov


## Steps:
0. Notice that we previously installed stack package `npm install @react-navigation/native-stack` and `npm install @react-navigation/native`
1. Create a second screen `RestaurantDetailScreen.js` at `src/screens/restaurants` and include basic contents as before
2. Create a file `RestaurantsStack.js` in `src/screens/restaurants` and include the logic to define two stack screens for `RestaurantsScreen` and `RestaurantDetailScreen`.

```TSX
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack'
import React from 'react'
import RestaurantDetailScreen from './RestaurantDetailScreen'
import RestaurantsScreen from './RestaurantsScreen'

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator()

export default function RestaurantsStack () {
  return (
        <Stack.Navigator>
            <Stack.Screen
                name='RestaurantsScreen'
                component={RestaurantsScreen} />
            <Stack.Screen
                name='RestaurantDetailScreen'
                component={RestaurantDetailScreen} />
        </Stack.Navigator>
  )
}
```
3. Update App.js in order to include the `RestaurantStack` as the component for the corresponding Tab and update the import
```TSX
        <Tab.Screen
          name="Restaurants"
          component={RestaurantsStack} />
```
You can now refresh your app and check that the stack is rendered, but no way of navigating from one screen to the other is defined.

4. In order to navigate from `RestaurantsScreen` to `RestaurantDetailScreen` we need to receive the navigation object and create a button for the action. Moreover, we can pass data from one screen to another including a second parameter:
```TSX
/* eslint-disable react/prop-types */
import React from 'react'
import { Button, Text, View } from 'react-native'

export default function RestaurantsScreen ({ navigation }) {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Random Restaurant</Text>
      <Button
        onPress={() => {
          navigation.navigate('RestaurantDetailScreen', { id: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) })
        }}
        title="Go to Random Restaurant Details"
      />
    </View>
  )
}
```
5. We can access data passed through the route object at `RestaurantDetailScreen.js`
```TSX
/* eslint-disable react/prop-types */
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

export default function RestaurantDetailScreen ({ route }) {
  const { id } = route.params
  return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
            <Text>Restaurant details. Id: {id}</Text>
        </View>
  )
}
```
6. Check the new version of the project, it should works like this:
https://snack.expo.dev/@afdez/lab4-3-nestednavigation
7. You can commit and push your changes and optionally include a tag

# 4. Creating your first component
Let's create a simple component which shows system information a if the app is running on development or production mode.
1. Create a folder `src/components` and a new file `SystemInfo.js` which shows the information about the platform (web, iOS, Android), version and if the app is running in production or development mode. Notice that in production apps runs faster due to several compiling and packaging optimizations.
```TSX
/* eslint-disable react/prop-types */
/* eslint-disable no-undef */

import React from 'react'
import { Platform, Text, View } from 'react-native'

export default function SystemInfo () {
  return (
        <View >
            <Text>Platform: {Platform.OS}.</Text>
            <Text>{Platform.Version ? `Version: ${Platform.Version}` : null}</Text>
            <Text>Mode: {__DEV__ ? 'Development' : 'Production'}</Text>
        </View>
  )
}
````
2. Use it in some screens by importing the component and including it in your views in the same way that you use button or text components.
3. Try from different platforms by running some simulator or visiting the website from your mobile. Note: Your mobile must be on the same network as the development server, and the server should be accessible using your private IP (not using localhost). You can run this application on your mobile phone using the Expo application. All you have to do is connect your mobile phone to the computer where the project has been deployed and press `a`.
4. Check the new version of the project, it should works like this:
https://snack.expo.dev/@afdez/lab4-4-firstcomponent
5. You can commit and push your changes and optionally include a tag

# 5. Packaging modes and debugging
0. Start a debugging session on the web server version and create a new debugging profile: Run -> Add Configuration -> Web App (Chrome) or Web App (Edge) or any other browser you have installed on your computer. Pay attention to the port where the solution is deployed, as this will be the port you need to change in the generated configuration profile. The next time you run this debugging profile, all you need to do is click the play button on top of the screen selecting Run and Debug section.
1. Include a breakpoint at `RestaurantDetailScreen.js`at line `const { id } = route.params`. Use the menus to inspect the values of variables and step over to next lines.
2. Do the same with the mobile version of the app. Open developer menu (shake your phone) and activate _Open JS_debugger_ option. It will open a new tab on your browser. Open Inspect tools and look for a debuggerworker in the sources tab->pages
3. Change to production mode by running following command: `npx expo start --no-dev`

# Extra: Styling
1. You can include to `App.js` some icons for the bottom tab options and remove default header (stack navigator shows its own header)
   * see https://docs.expo.dev/guides/icons/ and https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation#customizing-the-appearance
```Javascript
import { MaterialCommunityIcons } from '@expo/vector-icons'
```

```Javascript
<Tab.Navigator screenOptions={({ route }) => ({
  // eslint-disable-next-line react/display-name
  tabBarIcon: ({ color, size }) => {
    let iconName
    if (route.name === 'Restaurants') {
      iconName = 'silverware-fork-knife'
    } else if (route.name === 'Control Panel') {
      iconName = 'view-dashboard'
    } else if (route.name === 'Profile') {
      iconName = 'account-circle'
    }
    return <MaterialCommunityIcons name={iconName} color={color} size={size} />
  },
  headerShown: false
})}>
```
2. Include custom titles for each screen of the Restaurants Stack
```TSX
<Stack.Navigator>
  <Stack.Screen
      name='RestaurantsScreen'
      component={RestaurantsScreen}
      options={{
        title: 'Restaurants'
      }}/>
  <Stack.Screen
      name='RestaurantDetailScreen'
      component={RestaurantDetailScreen}
      options={{
        title: 'Restaurant Detail'
      }}/>
</Stack.Navigator>
```


4. Define a `src/styles/GlobalStyles.js` file including some constants for some colors named after: `brandPrimary`, `brandSecondary`, `background`, etc.
```TSX
const brandPrimary = '#be0f2e' // Granate US. rgba(190,15,46,255)
const brandPrimaryTap = '#AA001A' //  Granate US mÃ¡s oscuro
const brandSecondary = '#feca1b' // Amarillo US.rgba(254,202,27,255)
const brandSecondaryTap = '#EAB607' // amarillo US mÃ¡s oscuro
const brandSuccess = '#95be05' // verde US
const brandBackground = 'rgb(242, 242, 242)' // gris claro

export { brandPrimary, brandPrimaryTap, brandSecondary, brandSecondaryTap, brandSuccess, brandBackground }
```
   * Tip: you can use a VSCode extension to highlight hex, rgba color codos. E.g: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight
5. Use your branding colors, e.g. define a theme at `GlobalStyles.js` for ReactNavigation. See: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/themes/
```TSX
const navigationTheme = {
  dark: false,
  colors: {
    primary: brandSecondary,
    background: brandBackground,
    card: brandPrimary,
    text: '#ffffff',
    border: `${brandPrimary}99`,
    notification: `${brandSecondaryTap}ff` // badge
  }
}
```
6. Remember that you can include styles at the end of each component by creating a StyleSheet or getting style definition from GlobalStyles.js created previously. E.g:
```TSX
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center'
  }
})
```
